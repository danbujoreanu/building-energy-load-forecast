**Notes on E-36 through E-40:**

- **E-36 (CI active): ✅ COMPLETE 2026-04-22.** CI pipeline `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — 4 jobs: Tests (Python 3.10), Tests (Python 3.11), Code quality (black + ruff + mypy), Docker image builds. Branch protection on `main`: all 4 checks required, force pushes blocked, deletions restricted. Claude PR reviewer fires on every PR via `claude-review.yml`. **DAN-108 → Done.** App Runner deploy (Phase 7) is now unblocked.

- **E-37 (Pytest audit):** The DocuSign story: engineer wrote 35 Spock tests, all passing, all calling methods defined inside the test file itself. Zero regression protection. Fix: tests must import from `src/energy_forecast/` modules. See `docs/engineering/BEST_PRACTICES.md` Section 2.

- **E-38 (Segmented metrics):** Aggregate MAE of 4.0 kWh hides that peak-window errors (17–19h Mon–Fri at BGE peak rate €0.4928/kWh) cost 3× more than off-peak errors. Per-season accuracy matters: winter heating load behaves differently to summer solar export.

- **E-39 (Prompt eval):** Applies when Phase 2 LLM energy advisor (P-13, Gemini Flash) lands. Build the eval layer before wiring the LLM to production — keep prompt iteration separate from deployment cycle. Low priority until P-13 is scoped.

- **E-40 (Engineering RAG):** Extends the existing MBA/Career RAG infrastructure (already live). New `intel_engineering` Chroma collection. Corpus: DocuSign, Intercom, AWS, Netflix, Stripe, Shopify, Martin Fowler, Uber Engineering blogs. Article capture via Google Antigravity or Radish.build → Markdown → `scripts/intel_ingest.py`. Build after App Runner is live.

**Notes on outstanding items:**

- **E-17 (SRP refactor):** `run_pipeline.py` at 634 lines is a single-file monolith. Target: `scripts/stages/train_stage.py`, `evaluate_stage.py`, `explain_stage.py`, each ≤200 lines. `run_pipeline.py` becomes a thin orchestrator. Must be done before D-12 (App Runner deploy) or it ships with the debt baked in.

- **E-19 (Pydantic schemas):** Current `PredictionRequest` accepts `features: dict[str, float]` — any key, any count. The production LightGBM model expects exactly the 35 features selected by the 3-stage process (stored in `model.feature_name_`). The fix: at server startup, load the active model and read its `feature_name_` attribute to build a dynamic Pydantic model. Wrong feature names → 400 error with specific message, not a silent prediction with wrong inputs. New module: `src/energy_forecast/api/schemas.py`.

- **E-20 (JSONL audit log):** Every `ControlAction` decision appended to `outputs/logs/control_decisions.jsonl`. Fields: timestamp, building_id, city, action_type, confidence, reasoning, p50_load_kwh, solar_forecast_wm2, price_eur_kwh, dry_run, user_message. Required for EU AI Act Art. 52 ("every action logged") and for debugging overnight runs. `log_eddi.py` already does this for hardware status — ControlEngine needs the same discipline.

- **E-21 (Human review gate):** Currently `promote_to_active()` is fully automated (regression gate = only check). For a production system, add a `require_approval: bool = False` parameter. When `True`, new CANDIDATE models wait in registry with status `PENDING_REVIEW` until `registry.approve(version_id)` is called. Default `False` preserves current behaviour. Documented as a deliberate solo-founder trade-off in ADR-011.

- **E-22 (Drift check hook):** After `run_pipeline.py` Stage 3 completes, automatically call `DriftDetector.full_report()` and write JSON to `outputs/results/drift_reports/`. Log severity at INFO/WARNING/ERROR. This closes the gap between "we have drift detection" and "drift detection actually runs".

- **E-23 (Reliability):** Use `tenacity` library. Pattern: `@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10))` on all live connector `fetch_*` methods. Add `timeout=10` to every `requests.get()`. Fallback: if `OpenMeteoConnector` fails → use last-known cached weather from parquet with `logger.warning`. This is the highest-leverage reliability fix in the system — a 45-minute change that prevents 06:00 morning-brief failures.

- **E-24 (user_message):** Add `user_message: str` field to `ControlAction` dataclass. Populated by a `_format_user_message(action_type, confidence, env_state, forecast)` function. Rory's principle: every automated suggestion explains *why* in the language of the person reading it, not the engineer who wrote it. Examples:
  - `DEFER_HEATING` → "Good morning! Your panels should cover hot water heating after 11am — waiting could save you €0.18 today."
  - `HEAT_NOW` → "Night rate runs until 08:00 — Eddi will boost the tank now at the lower rate."
  - `ALERT_HIGH_DEMAND` → "Heads up: we expect high usage between 17–19h today. Running the dishwasher earlier could help."

### P-16 through P-19: Customer Intelligence (New — 2026-04-16)

**Context:** Tracking whether recommendations were acted on, and segmenting users by engagement behaviour. Primary value: (1) only feed Tier 1 user behaviour back as model signal — dormant users' non-actions are noise. (2) tariff switching rate is the North Star investor metric. (3) the potential-vs-actual savings gap is the strongest retention message.

|----|------|--------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| P-16 | **Prediction outcome tracking** — link each recommendation to its real outcome | 🔴 | HIGH | 2026-04-16 | Staff Data Scientist | D-25 + E-27 | `recommendation_outcomes` table: was_shown, was_acted_on, actual_kwh, potential_saving_eur, actual_saving_eur. Source: ESB CSV re-ingestion next day matches actuals to predictions |
| P-17 | **Customer intelligence dashboard** — potential savings gap, tariff switching rate, engagement score | 🟡 | HIGH | 2026-04-16 | Staff Data Scientist | P-16 | Three metrics per household: (a) potential_saving_eur - actual_saving_eur = "left on table"; (b) tariff_switched boolean; (c) engagement_rate = acted_on / shown. Display to user: "You saved €28 this month. You could have saved €47." |
| P-18 | **Customer tier segmentation engine** — 4-tier behavioural classification | 🟡 | MEDIUM | 2026-04-16 | Staff Product Manager | P-16 | Tier 1 Optimisers (≥70% acceptance, active ≤14d); Tier 2 Trackers (regular, <70% acceptance); Tier 3 Switchers (changed tariff — high commercial value); Tier 4 Dormant (no activity 30+d). Tiers inform notification frequency, re-engagement, and model feedback loop |
| P-19 | **Tiered prediction frequency** — Tier 4 weekly batch, Tier 1-3 daily | 🔵 | LOW | 2026-04-16 | Staff ML Engineer | P-18 | Primary value is not compute (2ms × 1000 users = 2s) — it is signal quality. Tier 4 non-actions are noise in the feedback loop. Only Tier 1 behaviour feeds model improvement. At 100k+ users this also reduces daily batch cost materially |
| P-20 | **Geographic demand heatmap** — household consumption density map for ESCO reporting | 🔵 | LOW | 2026-04-16 | — | Staff Data Scientist | D-25 + P-12 | GeoJSON + Leaflet.js (or Grafana Geomap panel). Shows aggregate anonymised consumption by postcode. Use case: ESCO reporting to ESB Networks, investor demo, heat pump adoption hotspot identification for SEAI partnership |
| P-21 | **Google Stitch UI prototyping sprint** — generate key screens before building Next.js | 🟡 | MEDIUM | 2026-04-16 | — | Rory + Dan | D-23 | Screens: morning brief, 24h forecast chart, device control, home plan score, settings. Use Stitch (Gemini Pro, 550 free generations/month) → export to Figma → hand-code in Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Tremor. Do this BEFORE writing frontend code. |

| P-22 | **Household Grafana dashboard** — consumption fingerprint, tariff breakdown, BTM signatures, savings gap | 🔴 | HIGH | 2026-04-21 | Staff Backend Engineer | DAN-96 | Second Grafana dashboard with `$household_id` template variable. 4 panels: (1) hourly heatmap, (2) tariff slot breakdown vs bill, (3) BTM asset signatures (post P-01), (4) savings gap. Zero new code — Grafana provisioning only. Blocks D-23 (consumer app needs validated UX before Next.js build). Linear: DAN-107. Streamlit NOT used here — Grafana handles the operator/dev view. |

### P-15: Rory Design Principle (Cross-Cutting)

|----|------|--------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| P-15 | **Rory design principle** — every consumer-facing output explains itself in plain human language | 🔴 | HIGH | 2026-04-15 | Rory + Staff Product Manager | Codified in `docs/APP_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`. Applies to: `ControlAction.user_message` (E-24), LLM Advisor framing (P-13), morning brief text, WhatsApp push copy (P-02). The principle: an AI that says "run dishwasher at 23:00" without explanation is a cost-reduction FAQ bot. An AI that says "your tariff drops to night rate at 23:00 — running it then saves you €0.40 tonight" is a knowledgeable friend. Trust is the product, not the automation. |

## Appendix B — IBM Agent Engineering Skills: Project Mapping

*Source: IBM YouTube — "The 7 Skills You Need to Build AI Agents"*
*Applied to Sparc Energy by: Staff ML Engineer + Staff Reliability Engineer + Rory*

| Skill | Status in Project | Action Items |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **1. System Design** — structure not spaghetti | ✅ Strong — layered architecture (DataConnector → FastAPI → ControlEngine → DeviceConnector) | E-17 (SRP refactor) — last structural debt |
| **2. Tool & Contract Design** — airtight schemas | ✅ Done — `schemas.register_features(model.feature_name_)` at startup; `/predict` rejects wrong keys with a 422 + full expected/missing/extra diff | E-25: context builder schema for LLM Advisor |
| **3. Retrieval Engineering** — context quality = answer ceiling | 🟡 Pre-MVP — no RAG yet | E-25: `context_builder.py` for LLM Advisor. Key principle: pre-computed stats, not raw time-series |
| **4. Reliability Engineering** — one failure doesn't bring down the house | ✅ Done — `_retry_http()` helper (3 attempts, exp. backoff), `_weather_cache` stale fallback, MyEnergiConnector returns `None` on failure | E-29: APScheduler health monitoring |
| **5. Security & Safety** — your agent is an attack surface | ✅ Good foundations — `dry_run=True` default, `DataValidator`, EU AI Act Art. 52 | E-26: LLM output filter for when P-13 ships |
| **6. Evaluation & Observability** — vibes don't scale | ✅ DriftDetector + ModelRegistry + JSONL audit log per ControlAction decision | E-27: wire audit log to PostgreSQL for Grafana visibility |
| **7. Product Thinking** — design for humans | ✅ Done — `ControlAction.user_message` + `_format_user_message()` in Rory voice | P-15 codified; P-02 WhatsApp delivery next |
